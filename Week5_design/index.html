        <h1>Design Principle Examples</h1>

        <h2>Signal to Noise</h2>
        <p>My first (good) example is of artist Hoodie Allen's tour page. There's a high signal to noise ratio
          being that there are in essence 4 main elements on the page. There is the site navigation, the image
          preceeding the body content, the body content of tour dates, and the footer bar with social media links.
          It's easy to understand what is going on, and where exactly you need to go to get the information you
           desire.

           <img src="img/hoodie.jpg" alt="Hoodie Allen's Tour Page"></a>
         </br></br>
         My second example is a personal web page for Phil Gyford. This represents a low signal to noise ratio.
         The layout and the content on the page makes it difficult to understand where to go to find the desired
          information. The page seems cluttered with information.
          <a href="http://www.gyford.com/">www.gyford.com</a></br>
          <img src="img/gyford.jpg" alt="Phil Gyford's home page"></a>


          <h2>Chunking</h2>
          <p>My (good) example is of a Pillsbury website for how to make a pepperoni pizza cake. The site
             lays out a step by step on how to make a pepperoni pizza cake. Instead of smashing the information
              together in one hard to read paragraph, they use images to break up the text and make the information
              more easy to manage
             <a href="http://www.pillsbury.com/everyday-eats/pizza/oh-yes-we-did-pepperoni-pizza-cake">
               Pepperoni Pizza Cake</a></br>
             <img src="img/pizza.jpg" alt="Pizza Cake recipe"></a>
           </br></br>

           <h2>Hick's Law</h2>
           <p>A bad example of this design principle is U2's website. Upon load there are a significant amout of
              menu options at the header, and once you get into the content of the page, there are
               a vast number of little content boxes each with different forms of content in them. It's
                difficult to decide what to do because of all of the presented options.
              <a href="http://www.u2.com/index/home">
                U2 Homepage</a></br>
              <img src="img/u2.jpg" alt="U2 Homepage"></a>
            </br></br>
            A good example of this design principle is Ticketfly's website. There are a couple simple items in a
             small header, then you're presented with a search bar to find events, and below that there are a few
              various events near you. It's easy to see where exactly to go as soon as you hit the homepage
              <a href="http://www.ticketfly.com/">
                Ticketfly</a></br>
              <img src="img/ticket.jpg" alt="Ticketfly Homepage"></a>


              <h2>Rule of thirds</h2>
              <p>A bad example of this design principle is Amazon's UK website. Upon loading there is an ad
                for Amazon FireTV and Prime video right smack in the middle of the site, with content surrounding
                it.
                 <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk">
                   Amazon.co.uk</a></br>
                 <img src="img/amazon.jpg" alt="UK Amazon"></a>
               </br></br>
               A good example of this design principle is Reddit's homepage. The main draw of content is focused
               on the left side of the rule of thirds. This makes it seem like the site isn't entirely center based
                 <a href="http://www.reddit.com/">
                   Reddit</a></br>
