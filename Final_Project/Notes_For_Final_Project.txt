1. You posted in your slides that we needed to run a validator on our HTML, and CSS, and that it needed to come out
  with no errors. For my _base.scss, I copied and pasted the CSS from the base HTML5 Boilerplate CSS. All of the CSS
  errors I'm getting in my code are from that base CSS.

2. I only got to doing the homepage, plus three additional pages instead of four. I have the navigation built in for
  the fourth page, but I intend to build out a PHP login interface for clients to schedule services through me, check
  on the status, see pricing, etc. I would have liked to have that done for now, but this will be my first real project
  writing in PHP, so I have a bit of learning to do still.

3. I've never had any formal training on HTML and CSS. I started writing web pages in the 6th grade, and I've basically
  self taught myself most things, with the help of Google. Point being my markup probably isn't the best looking, and
   I'm sure there are areas where I should have gone about it a different way, but didn't. Sometimes the long way is
   easiest for me :D

4. The final site is hosted at timothymontoya.com

5. I've really enjoyed taking this class, and I sure as hell have learned a lot from it. I look forward to your
  Web Administration class in the Spring.
